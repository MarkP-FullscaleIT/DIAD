## Overview
Introduction</br>
Today you will be learning various key features of the Power BI service. This is an introductory to intermediate course intended to learn how to author reports using Power BI Desktop and create operational dashboards via the Power BI Service.


## Data Set
The dataset you will use today is a sales and market share analysis. This type of analysis is very common for the office of a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). Unlike the office of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), a CMO is focused not only on companyâ€™s performance internally (how well do our products sell) but also externally (how well do we do against the competing products).
The company, VanArsdel, manufactures expensive electronic products that could be used for fun as well as work and it sells them directly to consumers nationwide as well as several other countries. VanArsdel and its competitors have retained a 3rd party marketing company to collect and anonymize industry sales so that all participants can benchmark themselves.
